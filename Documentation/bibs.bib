	structure and activity models is presented. Our proposed behavioral
	transformation maps behavior of the Simulink model as well as the
	MATLAB/Simulink simulation engine and provides an explicit simulation
	level behavior representation in the form of UML activity diagrams.
	The transformation has been partially implemented using the Atlas
	Transformation Language.},
